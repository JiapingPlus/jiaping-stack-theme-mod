The theme Stack is produced and [published](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack) by[CaiJimmy](https://github.com/CaiJimmy). The template I used is from Mantyke’s modified version of Stack[(Github Repository)](https://github.com/Mantyke)/[stack-theme-mod](https://github.com/Mantyke/Hugo-stack-theme-mod). Based on this, I also made some modifications to make it more suitable for me.

This personal blog is written in Chinese and mainly records my study and life. Hope you enjoy it :)
